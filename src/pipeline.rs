//! The write pipeline: store paths → chunks → packs → segment + head.
//!
//! Runs on drain (action post-step or idle-exit). Steps:
//!
//! 1. Query path info from the store database for every buffered path,
//!    expanded to its runtime closure unless disabled.
//! 2. Filter: invalid paths, upstream-signed paths (when the upstream
//!    cache filter is enabled. Derivation closures bypass it unless
//!    explicitly configured otherwise), paths already stored.
//! 3. Chunk each new path (FastCDC over NAR events) and verify the chunked
//!    representation reproduces the NAR hash recorded by Nix.
//! 4. Pack new chunks, upload each pack with its index.
//! 5. Publish everything this job pushed, found stored or substituted as
//!    one segment plus head under this root.
